hello, welcome. 

i'm aden `aka algae`, a university student currently studying to become a technical artist.

algae's game art tools are a collection of open-source game art tools for engines and DCC's, created by me. 

these tools are free for use by the public, i hope you find them useful.

*(more coming soon â€“ WIPs live in my personal repo [tech-art-tools](https://github.com/aden-tt/tech-art-tools))*

Pick what you need, download, and plug it into your engine/DCC.
